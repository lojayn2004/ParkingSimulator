# Console Based Parking Lot Simulator  🚗🚗

Simulate a parking system with **Java**, using **threads** and **semaphores** for synchronization and concurrency management. 🚦  

## 🚀 Features  
-  **Thread Synchronization**: Manage parking spots across 3 gates.   
- **Dynamic Reporting**: Logs parking activity and shows total cars served.  
- **Concurrency Control**: Prevents race conditions with semaphores.  

## 🛠️ How It Works  
1. **Parking Spots**: 4 spots shared among cars.  
2. **Gates**: 3 gates handle car arrivals independently.  
3. **Input**: Car schedules are read from a text file.  
4. **Output**: Logs show car arrivals, parking status, and departures.  

## ⚙️ Technologies Used 
- Java ☕  
- Threads 🧵  
- Semaphores 🚦
